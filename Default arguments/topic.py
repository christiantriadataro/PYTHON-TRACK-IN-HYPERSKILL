# Theory: Default arguments

# In addition to several ways that you can use to pass arguments
# into functions, Python also has special syntax for accepting
# these values from a function call. So, while in earlier topics we
# have learned how to work with arguments, now we will focus on
# parameters, the ones with default values in particular, and look
# into them in more detail.

# 1. Defaults
# In Python, functions can have paramaters with default values.
# Default parameters are specified in the function definition and
# contain default values for arguments in case they are not
# provided with a function call. Have a look at this code:
def locate(place, planet="Earth"):
    print(place, "on", planet)

locate("Berlin")                        # Berlin on Earth
locate("Breakfast", planet="Pluto")     # Breakfast on Pluto
locate("Craters", "Mercury")            # Craters on Mercury
 
# Here we have two parameters, place and planet. The first one
# has no default value, so we should always specify it when 
# calling the function. The second one, in contrast, can be
# omitted, in which case the function will simply take the default
# value.

# Parameters with default values, such as planet, are optional in
# some way. You can easily call a function without them and rely
# on preset values. As in the example above, most of the places
# we might want to find are most likely on Earth. However, new
# values can be assigned to them either by name or by position.

# When you declare this function, place non-default parameters
# first and then those with default values. If you try doing the
# opposite, SyntaxError will crop up:

# def greet(greeting="Hello!, ", name):
#    print(greeting, name)
# SyntaxError: non-default argument follows default argument

# In this case, you will not be able to use the default value at all.
# As the second parameter still requires a value, we would always
# have to write both values in a call, which makes not much
# sense. So, when you declare a function, pay attention to the
# order of the parameters.

# 2. Mutable objects as defaults
# When it comes to mutable objects, things are getting trickier.
# Let's set a list as a default value and see how it works:
def add_player(player, team=[]):
    ...
    team.append(player)
    return team

# As you can see, the function simply adds a new player to a team.
# First, we will give both arguments to it:
ice_hockey_team = add_player("Chris", ["Robert", "Alice"])
print(ice_hockey_team)

# Everything looks fine. However, when we call it relying on the
# default value, the function's behavior would differ from what 
# you might have expected:
rugby_team = add_player("Robin")
print(rugby_team)   # ['Robin']

football_team = add_player('Andrew')
print(football_team)   # ['Robin', 'Andrew']
print(rugby_team)      # ['Robin', 'Andrew']

# Instead of two separate lists for teams, surprisingly, you got just
# one. With every subsequent call, the function will append a new
# item to this list. Why so? It turns out that default parameter
# values are evaluated once.

# After you have declared a function, a new object for a default
# value is created. It will be used from this point on. This means
# that if the function modifies this object in some way, the default
# value in the mutable will change too. for this reason, you should
# use mutable default values carefully.

# Here is a common workaround to fix the function from our
# earlier example:
def add_player(player, team=None):
    if team is None:
        team = []
    team.append(player)
    return team

# Setting the default value to None and explicitly reassigning the
# value of the team parameter allows you to create a new list
# each time this function is called.

# 3. PEP time
# Look at the declared functions shown in this optic one more
# time, for example, def locate(place, planet="Earth"): ...
# Have you noticed missing spaces around the equals sign? Their
# absence is not accidental. By 1.0 PEP 8 convention, you should not
# put spaces around = when indicating a keyword argument. This
# holds true for parameters with default values.

# 4. Summary
# Let's go over the main points we have discussed:
# - Python Functions can be quite flexible, you can use them
#   passing fewer arguments in a call (thanks to default 
#   values).
# - You should pay close attention to the order of parameters
#   when you declare functions. Place non-default parameters
#   first and those with default vlaues afterward.
# - Mutable defaults may work contrary to your intentions, as
#   their values are created once at the runtime. If so, a
#   common way to avoid trouble is by using None by default
#   and changing the parameter's value in the function's body.
