    "\n",

    "#### 2. What are \"magic\" methods?\n",
    "Magic methods are special methods that make using objects much easier. They are recognizable in the code of the class definitions because they are enclosed in **double underscores**: for example `__init__` is one of those \"magic\" methods in Python. Since they are characterized by double underscores they are often called **dunders**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dunders are not meant to be invoked directly by you or the user of your classes, it happens internally on a certain action. For example, we do not explicitly call the `__init__` method when we create a new object of the class, but instead, this method is invoked internally. All we need to do is define the method inside the class in a way that makes sense for our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different dunders that you can use, but in this topic, we will focus on the most helpful ones.\n"

    "#### 3. __new__ vs __init__\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've been calling `__init__` the constructor of the class, but in reality, it is its initializer. New object of the class are in fact created by the `__new__` method that in its turn calls the `__init__` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, there is no need to define a special `__new__` method, but it can be useful if we want to return instances of other classes or restrict the number of objects in our class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine, for example, that we want to create a class `Sun` and make sure that we create only one object of this class. We would need to define a class variable that would track the number of instances in the class and forbid the creation of new ones if the limit has been reached."
