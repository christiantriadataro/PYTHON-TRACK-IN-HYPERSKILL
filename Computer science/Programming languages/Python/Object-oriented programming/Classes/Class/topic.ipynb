    "#### Theory\n",
    "As you already know, **object-oriented programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects. Objects interact with eac other and that is how the program functions. Objects have states and behaviors. Many objects can have similar characteristics and if you need to work with them in your program it may be easier to create a **class** for similar objects. Classes represent the common structure of similar objects: their data and their behavior."

A method is similar to a function in that it is a block of code that has a name and performs a certain action. Methods, however, are not independent since they are defined within a class. Data within classes are stored in the **attributes** (variables) and there are two kinds of them: **class attributes** and **instance attributes**. The difference between those two will be explained below."
