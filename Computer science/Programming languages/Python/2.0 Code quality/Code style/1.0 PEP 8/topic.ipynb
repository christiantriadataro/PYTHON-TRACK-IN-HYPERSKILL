It is the way you write code that affects general readability. That is why you need to follow common conventions concerning programming style, so other programmers are able to read your code easily.\n",

    "You may ask, where do these conventions come from? There is a document that is called [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). The key idea of it is to use the same code style for all Python projects as if they were written by the same programmer. This document guarantees that even a beginner will understand the code, written by any other developer."
