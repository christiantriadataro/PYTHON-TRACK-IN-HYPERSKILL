# Theory: Testing user input

# When we write programs in Python, we often want to interact
# with a user, for example, to ask them to enter a value to obtain a
# further result. We need to be very careful with that! Users may
# enter not what they were asked, and it can lead to unexpected
# errors. To prevent this, we should test the user's input. The idea
# is to take into account all scenarios and process them correctly.
# This topic will cover the basics of such testings.

# 1. Types of values in testing user's input
# Input values can be divided into three groups:
# - expected values are correct input values, a program
#   requires them for implementing next steps.
# - border values when we deal with numeric input; they limit
#   the range of expected inputs and may be included or not,
#   so they could either be expected or invalid values. We
#   mention them separately because you should always be
#   careful with them.

# - invalid values are incorrect inputs: they are not what we
#   ask for.

# Now let's illustrate different types of values with an example.
# Imagine, we ask a user to input a number:

# your_int = int(input("Enter a integer number between 25 and 50: "))

# So that:
# 1. The integers from 26 to 49 are expected values. They are
#    expected from a user.
# 2. 25 and 50 are border values. In our example, we have not
#    specified whether we want them or not, so they can be
#    either expected or invalid values. In a real problem, we will
#    have to explain it to the user and process them
#    accordingly.
# 3. Other integers, floats, or strings are invalid values.

# In the following sections, we will discuss the ways of testing
# such inputs in our code.

# 2. If statements for testing
# Let's modify our code and read the user input step by step so
# that we could process every value without errors. First, we
# create a function that checks the given integer and prints a
# message if it is a correct value or not:

def check(x):
    if 25 < x < 50:
        print(x, "is the right number!")
    else:
        print(x, "is the wrong number!")


# your_int = int(input("Enter a integer number between 25 and 50: "))
# check(your_int)


# Be careful, the border values are not included! Let's run our
# code several times and see what we will get with different
# integers as inputs:

# As expected value:
# Enter an integer number between 25 and 50: 45
# 45 is the right number!

# A border value:
# Enter an integer number between 25 and 50: 25
# 25 is the wrong number!

# An invalid value:
# Enter an integer number between 25 and 50: 3
# 3 is the wrong number!

# As you can imagine, such conditional statements are not
# enough to test the user input. Let's see what else we can do.

# 3. Try-except block to deal with exceptions
# If our user enters a float or a string, the ValueError will occur
# because the int() function would not be able to convert the
# input into an integer:

# Enter an integer number between 25 and 50: wrong!
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "exercise.py", line 9, in
#       your_int = int(input("Enter a number between 25 and 50: ")
# ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'wrong!'

# This behavior is wrong for our program!  It should continue
# executing if an invalid value was entered. To deal with the error,
# we can use the try-except block. Note that we modify the
# lines where the program takes the input.

def check(x):
    if 25 < x < 50:
        print(x, "is the right number!")
    else:
        print(x, "is the wrong number!")

    try:
        your_int = int(input("Enter a integer number between 25 and 50: "))
        check(your_int)
    except ValueError:
        print("Your input is not an integer!")


# Now, if the user enters a float or a string, it will produce no
# errors:

# Enter an integer number between 25 and 50: wrong!
# Your input is not an integer!

# The while loop can also be extremely useful for us in the task
# of handling the user input.


# 4. While loop for continuous input request
# In the previous examples, we needed to re-run the code each
# time to enter another value. However, when working with a user,
# our program should ask for the input until a correct value is
# entered. We can do so with the while loop.

# In the example below, we combine if statements, try-except
# block, and while loops for multiple checking. We also consider
# the border values as the expected ones from now on. We should
# specify this in the message for a user, and process the values
# respectively in the code. Note that it is more convenient now to
# read the input inside the function.

def check_input():
    while True:
        try:
            your_int = int(input("Enter an integer number between 25 and 50 (inclusively): "))
            if 25 <= your_int <= 50:  # border values are now included
                print(your_int, "is the right number!")
                break
            else:
                print(your_int, "is the wrong number! Try again!")
        except ValueError:
            print("Your input is not an integer! Try again!")


check_input()
    # Now, the program will run until the user enters what we asked
    # them to:

    # Enter an integer number between 25 and 50 (inclusively):
    # Your input is not an integer! Try again!
    # Enter an integer number between 25 and 50 (inclusively):
    # Your input is not an integer! Try again!
    # Enter an integer number between 25 and 50 (inclusively):
    # 12 is the wrong number number! Try again!
    # Enter an integer number between 25 and 50 (inclusively):
    # 45 is the right number!

    # Finally, our program can process all types of inputs, and will not
    # crash if the user behaves unexpectedly.

    # 5. Built-in methods for string testing
    # Our previous examples described integer inputs, but in a great
    # number of situations, we need to deal with strings. Checking
    # strings may be needed in various situations. Imagine that you
    # are creating a program to check the password reliability. Python
    # provides several methods that can be used for string input
    # testing. They will allow you to check, for instance, if your
    # password contains both integers and letters of different cases.
    # Below we present a table with the string methods and their
    # brief explanations.

    # Method            The returned value
    # str.islower()     True if there are only symbols of the lower case in the string.

    # str.isupper()     True if there are only symbols of the upper case in the string.

    # str.isalpha()     True if the string consists only of letters (upper/lower case)/

    # str.isdigit()     True if the string consists only of digits.

    # str.isnumeric()   True if the string consists of digits and characters that have features of
    #                   Unicode digits (their Numeric_Type feature is set to Digit, Decimal or
    #                   Numeric). For instance, the fraction % is a symbol of Unicode, meanwhile
    #                   the string "5/8" contains three symbols. The second example will return
    #                   False as there is a slash, whose type is not the Numeric_Type.

    # str.isalnum()     True if the string consists only of digits and letters (upper/lower case).


# Now let's look at an example. There is a function below that
# takes a string and checks if it is a name; it should contain only
# letters, start with a capital letter, and the rest of the letters
# should be lowercase. These conditions are very simple and may
# not identify all names correctly, but you can still see how the
# string methods work:

# def check_name(x):
#     if x.isalpha() and x[0].isupper() and x[1:].islower():
#         print("The name is", x)
#     else:
#         print(x, "is not a name!")
#
#
# name = input("Enter a name: ")
# check_name(name)

# If any of the conditions is not met, False will be returned and
# the code will execute the else statement.

# Enter a name: Marie
# The name is Marie

# Enter a name: no
# no is not a name!

# Enter a name: Why?
# Why? is not a name!

# Enter a name: HaHa
# HaHa is not a name!

# Take a look at the question mark in the third input. It is not a
# letter, so x.isalpha() returns False.

# 6. Summary
# The testing of user inputs is a pivotal step for creating a working
# piece of code. It allows us to process all possible inputs of a
# user and prevent some errors. So far, we have discussed the
# following:

# - we have three main types of input values: the expected
#   (correct values), the border (end-points of the expected
#   range), and the invalid (incorrect values) ones;

# - how to test inputs with the help of the if statements and
#   update your testing code using the while loops and the
#   try-expect blocks;
# - the methods that can be used for string testing -
#   str.isdigit(), str.isalpha(), str.isnumeric(),
#   str.isalnum(), str.isupper(), and str.islower().

# Of course, these methods are the basics ones. For instance, you
# can process inputs with the help of the regular expressions. You can
# find out more than about them in our topic on regular expressions.
