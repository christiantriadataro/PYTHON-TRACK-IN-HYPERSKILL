# Theory: Assert statement

# Testing exists in a great variety of programming languages, its
# aim is to check whether your code contains errors and if so,
# what their causes are. It does not have to be hard, you can start
# with easy steps. In this topic, we are going to deal with the
# assert statement. It is a useful debugging tool that uses Boolean
# logic and checks whether a given expression is true or false. If
# the condition is True, the program will keep running.
# Otherwise, it will return the AssertionError.

# 1. Syntax of assert statements
# The assert keyword can be used in two ways.

# 1
# assert <condition>

# 2
# assert <condition>, <message>

# The <condition> attribute shows what you want to test, so it is
# always required. When the condition is false, the
# AssertionError is raised. The optional <message> attribute
# may be used to specify the message displayed with the error.
# Now let's illustrate assert statements in action.

# 1
# word = input("Enter a word: ")
# assert word != "cat"
# print("Your word is", word)

# 2
# word = input("Enter a word: ")
# message = "'cat' is the wrong word!"
# assert word != "cat", message
# print("Your word is", word)

# For instance, if you enter the word dog in both examples, the
# condition word != 'cat' will be True, and you will have the
# following output:

# Your word is dog

# However, if you happen to enter cat, the AssertionError will
# be raised. In the second case, an error message will also appear.

# 1
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "exercise.py", line 2, in <module>
#       assert word != "cat"
# AssertionError

# 2
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "exercise.py", line 3, in <module>
#       assert word != "cat", message
# AssertionError: 'cat' is the wrong word!

# As you can see, the AssertionError is a built-in error, so you
# can handle it with the try - except block.

# try:
#     word = input("Enter a word: ")
#     message = "'cat' is a wrong word!"
#     assert word != "cat", message
#     print("Your word is", word)
# except AssertionError as err:
#     print(err)

# We can also check several variables or use more sophisticated
# logical expressions with the help of the assert keyword:

# x = 4
# y = 2
# assert (x ** 2 / y ** 2) - y != 2, "There are wrong values"
# print(x, y)

# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "exercise.py", line 3, in
#       assert (x ** 2 / y ** 2) - y != 2, "There are wrong values!
# AssertionError: There are wrong values!

# Finally, the assert keyword can be used with functions. In the
# example below the AssertionError is raised when the
# parameter 2 given to the function does not fulfill the condition
# in the test_mark(i).

# def test_mark(i):
#     message = "This student got a bar mark!"
#     assert i > 4, message
#     return i
#
#
# print(test_mark(5))  # 5
# print(test_mark(2))

# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "exercise.py", line 7, in
#       print(test_mark(i))
#   File "exercise.py", line 3, in test_mark
#       assert i > 4, message
# AssertionError: This student got a bad mark!

# 2. Assert vs Raise
# You may have noticed that raise and assert are similar to
# each other. What is the actual difference between them?

# - raise is used for raising an exception;
# - assert is used for raising an exception if the given
#   condition is False.

# Let's analyze some examples.
word = input("Enter a word: ")
if word != "cat":
    print(word)
else:
    raise ValueError("There is a wrong word!")

# As you can see, the raise keyword together with the if-else
# statement is very similar to the assert keyword, but their
# purposes are different. In the first case, raise is used mainly
# for data validation, while assert is used for debugging.

# Python documentation (The Assert Statement paragraph) also
# provides an explanation of how the assert keyword works. The
# first example shows raising the error without a message and the
# second one - with the message.

# 1
# if __debug__:
#     if not condition:
#             raise AssertionError

# 2
# if __debug__:
#     if not condition:
#             raise AssertionError, message

# The __debug__ is a built-in variable that is True by default and
# is only set to False when Python is started in teh optimization
# mode, so the first lines can be interpreted as if True.

# Mind the difference between the raise and the assert
# keywords and use them wisely.

# 3. Summary
# In this topic, you have learned some basics of the assert
# keyword, a tool for program testing:
# - the purpose of the assert keyword is to check whether a
#   condition is False;
# - to use the assert keyword, we should specify the
#   mandatory attribute <condition> and an optional
#   <message>;
# - as opposed to raise, the assert keyword is used for
#   debugging.
