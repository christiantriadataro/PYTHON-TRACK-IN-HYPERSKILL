# Theory: Errors

# The first thing you need to know about programming is how to
# print "Hello!, world!". The second one is that this might be a
# challenging task, as even such a tiny script can contain various
# errors. Here you are:

# print("Hello!, world!"

# If you run this code, you'll get this:

# Traceback (most recent call last):
#    File "FULL/PATH/TO_YOUR/SCRIPT.PY", line 1
#       print("Hello!, world!"
#                           ^

# SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing

# Traceback is a stack trace that appears when your code causes
# an error and it reports detailed information on that particular
# error, indicating the specific files in which the error occurred.
# Nonetheless, the lines that are the most informative for us right
# now are the last two. They point out the mistake in your code.

# This might seem a little bit frustrating, but generally what
# erros are designed for is to allow Python to communicate with
# you. Whenever you see those red threatening lines - don't
# panic! Just read carefully whay they are saying.

# 1. Syntax errors
# In the example above, we can clearly see the magic word
# SyntaxError that is likely to haunt you throughout the period of
# getting used to Python. Alarge variety of different error are
# referred to as syntax erros. What they usually mean is that 
# Python has encountered a problem while trying to compile your
# program and it can't even execute it.

# If you carefully read the text of a traceback, it will help you to
# find mistakes and correct them quite easily, as you can see an
# arrow pointing to the exact place where Python found the
# mistake in your code. Every syntax error has an associated
# value. It describes an error in detail. In the example, "EOF" in the
# message "SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing"
# standings for the end of a file. This message means that something
# else had been expected after your statement, but you didn't
# pass it to the interpreter. In our case, there should've been a
# closing round bracket ")".

# Mistakes won't be so obvious all the time. It is quite likely that 
# the message you'll get as an associated value will be the most
# common and obscure "invalid syntax", which isn't really
# helpful. Well, anyway, to locate the problem it's enough to know
# that the error is in the syntax.

# 2. Common erros for beginners
# Some of the most common syntax errors are:
# - wrong spelling of keywords and function names, e.g.
#   While instead of while, pint instead of print;
# - the wrong number of parentheses in function call, e.g.
#   print "just one round bracket");
# - indents are also the fertile soil for errors, therefor, use
#   spaces and tabs carefully;
# - quotes. Don't forget to wrap a string in quotes of the same
#   type: triple quotes for multi-line strings, double or single
#   quotes for ordinary strings.

# Modern IDEs tend to check everything for you and kindly
# highlight the places where you have made a mistake or typo, but
# don't rely on this too much and be ready to read the traceback
# yourself.

#    Mind that Python stops compiling your program after
#    finding the first Syntax error, so it might take a while to fix
#    every single mistake.

# Check the following piece of code, for example. It looks like a 
# Petri dish of syntax errors:

# missing_quote = "this is a mistake!
# another_string = this is not a string!
# parted_string = 'I'd like to be highlighted, but ' prnit("I am not")

# As you can see, there are plenty of syntax errors in this tiny
# piece of code. If you've checked and corrected everything from
# the list above and yet you encounter those error messages - 
# don't worry! Once again, it's just Python trying to tell you that
# something went wrong. Take a deep breath, reread the article,
# and continue perfecting your programming skills!

# In this topic, we learned what traceback is, look at syntax errors
# in detail, and went through several common erros you, as a 
# beginner, may encounter.
