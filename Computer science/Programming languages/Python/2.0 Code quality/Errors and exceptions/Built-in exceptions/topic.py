# Theory: Built-in exceptions

# Even good programmers make mistakes sometimes. You can
# divide an integer by zero by mistake or miss a bracket when
# working with lists. Python handles these cases pretty well, it
# usually doesn't lead to unexpected bugs. But if they happen, the
# built-in exceptions are raised. In this topic, we are going to
# present a detailed description of built-in exceptions. Some of
# them (NameError, TypeError, and ValueError) were described 
# in the previous topics, but there are more exceptions that we
# need to learn.

# 1. Hierarchy of Exceptions
# We should note that all built-in exceptions have a hierarchy, 
# some of the exceptions in the hierrarchy may lead to more
# specific exceptions. Take a look at the full structure of the built-
# in exceptions:

# BaseException
#  +-- SystemExit
#  +-- KeyboardInterrupt
#  +-- GeneratorExit
#  +-- Exception
#       +-- StopIteration
#       +-- StopAsyncIteration
#       +-- ArithmeticError
#       |    +-- FloatingPointError
#       |    +-- OverflowError
#       |    +-- ZeroDivisionError
#       +-- AssertionError
#       +-- AttributeError
#       +-- BufferError
#       +-- EOFError
#       +-- ImportError
#       |    +-- ModuleNotFoundError
#       +-- LookupError
#       |    +-- IndexError
#       |    +-- KeyError
#       +-- MemoryError
#       +-- NameError
#       |    +-- UnboundLocalError
#       +-- OSError
#       |    +-- BlockingIOError
#       |    +-- ChildProcessError
#       |    +-- ConnectionError
#       |    |    +-- BrokenPipeError
#       |    |    +-- ConnectionAbortedError
#       |    |    +-- ConnectionRefusedError
#       |    |    +-- ConnectionResetError
#       |    +-- FileExistsError
#       |    +-- FileNotFoundError
#       |    +-- InterruptedError
#       |    +-- IsADirectoryError
#       |    +-- NotADirectoryError
#       |    +-- PermissionError
#       |    +-- ProcessLookupError
#       |    +-- TimeoutError
#       +-- ReferenceError
#       +-- RuntimeError
#       |    +-- NotImplementedError
#       |    +-- RecursionError
#       +-- SyntaxError
#       |    +-- IndentationError
#       |    |    +-- TabError
#       +-- SystemError
#       +-- TypeError
#       +-- ValueError
#       |    +-- UnicodeError
#       |    |    +-- UnicodeDecodeError
#       |    |    +-- UnicodeEncodeError
#       |    |    +-- UnicodeTranslateError
#       +-- Warning
#       |    +-- DeprecationWarning
#       |    +-- PendingDeprecationWarning
#       |    +-- RuntimeWarning
#       |    +-- SyntaxWarning
#       |    +-- UserWarning
#       |    +-- FutureWarning
#       |    +-- ImportWarning
#       |    +-- UnicodeWarning
#       |    +-- BytesWarning
#       |    +-- ResourceWarning

# Don't be afraid, we know, it's hard to remember the hierarchy at
# once. You can do it step-by-step when you have free time. Below
# we try to focus on the main features of the structure you need
# to know.

# First of all, remember that the BaseException class is a base
# class for all built-in exceptions, which we can consider as the
# root of all exceptions. This exception is never raised on its own
# and should be inherited by other exception classes. In terms of 
# this heirarchy, other classes are know as subclasses of the 
# root class. For instance, the IndexError is a subclass of the
# LookupError class. At the same time, the LookupError itself is
# a subclass of the Exception class.

# The BaseException subclasses include SystemExit,
# KeyboardInterrupt, GeneratorExit and Exception.

# - The SystemExit is raised when the sys.exit() function
#   is used to terminate the program.
# - The KeyboardInterrupt is raised when the user hits the
# interrupt key, e.g. Ctrl + C during the execution of a
# program.
# - The GeneratorExit appears when you generator is being
#   closed (it will be covered later).
# - The most common subclass is the Exception class. It
#   contains all exceptions that are considered as errors and
#   warnings.

# 2. Built-in Exception Types
# Before we start analyzing the pieces of code, take a look at the
# table with the built-in exceptions that programmers often meet
# in their code: 

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# |      Exception      |                 Explanation                 |
# |---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
# |     SyntaxError     |  Raised when a statement uses the wrong     |
# |                     |                   syntax.                   |
# |---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
# |      TypeError      |  Raised when any operation/function is applied
# |                     |     to an object of inappriopriate type.    |
# |---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
# |      ValueError     |  Raised when any operation/function accepts an
# |                     |     argument with an inappriopriate value.  |
# |---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
# |       OSError       |  Raised when a system function returns a    |
# |                     |           system-related error.             |
# |---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
# |     ImportError     |  Raised when the imported library is not found.
# |---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
# |       EOFError      |   Raised when input() reaches the end of the| 
# |                     |     file (EOF) without reading any data.    |
# |---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
# |      NameError      |    Raised when a local or global name is not found.
# |---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
# |      IndexError     |    Raised when a sequence subscript is out of 
# |                     |                   range.                    |
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Now, let's shed some more light on them!


# 3. SyntaxError
# The first error is the SyntaxError. Take a look at the first 
# example:

# new_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5
# print(new_list)
#   File "exercise.py", line 2
#       print(new_list)
#       ^
# SyntaxError: invalid syntax

# The list doesn't have the right-side bracket ], that's why the
# SyntaxError is raised. Below is another example:
# i := 3
#   File "<stdin>", line 1
#       i := 3
#          ^
# SyntaxError: invalid syntax

# The expression is wrong and Python tells us about it by raising
# SyntaxError.

#       The SyntaxError is generally very easy to fix: you should
#       make sure that all brackets, commas, quotation marks are
#       in place and that everything is syntactically correct in the
#       line that the error points out.


# 4. TypeError
# Now let's obseve a TypeErro:
# a = 'Python' + 25
# print(a)
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "exercise.py", line 1, in <module>
#       a = 'Python' + 25
# TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str

# We tried to concatenate a string and an integer, that's why the
# TypeError was raised. This can happen to you on Hyperskill.
# For example, if you read input and forget to convert it into an
# integer before performing some operations:

# num = input()
# print(num / 100)
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
# TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'int'

#       To get rid of this error, check taht you perform operations
#       on variables of the correct data type.

# 5. ValueError
# In the code below, the input accepts a string that can't be
# converted to an integer, that's why the ValueError is raised:

user_input = input('Enter an integer: ')   # you enter 'cat' here
a = int(user_input)
print(a)

# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "exercise.py", line 1, in <module>
#       a = int(user_input)
# ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'cat'

# This error may also occur with a list:
cats = ['Tommy', 'Timmy', 'Ram']
cats.remove('Alex')
print(cats)

# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "exercise.py", line 2, in <module>
#       cats.remove('Alex')
# ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list

# The method remove() can't delete the specified stirng from the
# list because there's no such element there.

#       The ValueError can be caused by various reasons. The
# general advice is to read the error message and check that
# the function can process the given object.

# 6. OSError
# The next example illustrates the OSError. Some subclasses of
# this error may appear when you work with files. For example, if
# we try to open a file that doesn't exist, the FileNotFoundError
# will be raised:
f = open('i_dont_exist.txt')
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "exercise.py", line 1, in <module>
#       f = open('i_dont_exist.txt')
# FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'i_dont'_exist.txt'

# Of course, there a lot of other examples when the OSEror
# and its subclasses can be raised.

#       When an OSError occurs, the reason for it is stated in the 
#       description

# 7. ImportError
# The ImportError may occur if you import a non-existing
# functions:

from math import square
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
# ImportError: cannot import name 'square'

# Or when a spelling mistake was made in the module name:
import maths
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "exercise.py", line 1, in <module>
#       import maths
# ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'maths'

# Note that in this case, the ModuleNotFoundError is a subclass of
# the ImportError. Why so? The module math exists in the first
# example, but there's no such function as square. In Python, 
# there's no special error subclass for this situation, so a more
# general ImportError is raised. In the second example, however,
# we try to import the module that doesn't exist in Python, so the
# ModuleNotFoundError is raised.

#       Apart from checking the spelling, make sure that the
#       module you want to import is installed. If you forgot to do
#       so, it would not be available in your program, so Python
#       will raise this error.

# 8. EOFError
# Now let's discuss the EOFError. We have mentioned that it is
# raised when the input has no data to read. You can run into this
# error on Hyperskill when, for instance, you have 2 integers as an
# input, one per line, but you call input() three times:
first = input()
second = input()
third = input()  # this was not expected

# Then, the output of the test can look like this:
# Failed test #1 of 5. Runtime error

# Error:
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "jailed_code", line 2, in <module>
#       third = input()
# EOFError: EOF when reading a line

# You will not come across this problem often outsied
# Hyperskill. When you get this error on Hyperskill, make
# sure that you read the input exactly as many times as it is
# stated in the task description.

# 9. NameError
# Take a look at the following code:
prant("Hello!, world!")
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "exercise.py", line 1, in <module>
#       prant("Hello!, world!")
# NameError: name 'prant' is not defined

# The function print() is misspelled, so Python does not
# recognize it. The situation is the same when you mess up the
# variable names:

a = 'Hello!, world!'
print(b)
# Traceback (most recent call last):
# File "exercise.py", line 2, in <module>
# print(b)
# NameError: name 'b' is not defined

#       If you get this error, just make sure that all functions and
#       variables are correctly spelled and refer to the existing
#       objects.

# 10. IndexError
# Finally, let's proceed to the IndexError.
new_list = ['the only element']
print(new_list[1])
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "exercise.py", line 2, in <module>
#       print(new_list[1])
# IndexError: list index out of range

# The list in the example above contains the only element, but we
# try to get an element with the index equal to 1. Mind that
# indexing in lists starts with 0. That's why the IndexError is
# raised.

#       This is a very common mistake with lists. Check the
#       indexes you are passing to your list with care and mind the
#       number of values it has in total.

# 11. Summary
# So far, we highlighted some important issues dedicated to teh
# built-in exceptions:
# - we reviewed the hierarchy of exceptions;
# - we learned what classes and subclasses stands  for;
# - we analyzed some built-in exceptions and discussed the
#   way around them.

# If you are keen on reading more information, check the Built-in
# Exceptions part of the official doc. But for now, let's proceed to
# the comprehension tasks and applications to strengthen your
# knowledge!
