## Theory: Queue in Python

#### 1. Queue
**Queue** is a linear data structure that implements the first-
in-first-out (FIFO) principle, meaning that new elements
can be added to the back of the queue, while removing an
element is only possible from its head. Queue is really
just like real-life line in  a supermarket: customers
who come first are attended first, while the others are 
waiting for their turn.

Typically queue supports the following two basic
operations:
- **enqueue**, that adds a new element to the back of the 
  queue.
- **dequeue**, that removes the first element of the 
  queue.

Sometimes, operations **front** and **rear** are also supported.
They return the first and the last element of the queue
respectively without removing them.

In practice, queues are especially useful in threaded
programming when information must be exchanged
between multiple threads. Queues are at the heart of job
schedulers, helping to schedule delayed tasks efficiently
while preserving the order in which they must be
performed.

In this topic, you will be get familiar with a data structure
called queue and how to implement it in Python.

#### 2. Deque
Before we learn how to implement in Python, we 
should get familiar with one more data structure that is
closely related, namely **deque**. Deque stands for *'double-
ended queue'* and allows for the elements to be added
and removed from either side.

In Python, you can find deque implementation in the 
`collections` module. The essential methods are 
`append(element)` and `appendleft(element)`, which add a 
new element to the right or left side of the deque
respectively, as well as `pop()` and `popleft()`, which
remove the first element from the corresponding side of 
the deque.

Let's take a look at the example:
  
      from collections import deque

      my_deque = deque()

      my_deque.append('Middle')
      my_deque.append('Right')

      my_deque.appendleft('Left')

      print(my_deque)

      # deque(['Left', 'Middle', 'Right'])

      print(my_deque.pop())

      # Right

      print(my_deque())

      # deque(['Left', 'Middle'])

      print(my_deque.popleft())

      # Left

      print(my_deque())

      # deque(['Middle'])
      
Deque is implemented as a doubly linked list, meaning 
that its elements aren't stored next to each other in
memory like the elements of the conventional list. By
contrast, only smaller chunks of elements are stored
together, and each such chunk stores the references to 
the previous chunk and to the next one. This architecture
enables quicker append and pop operations from both
ends of the deque.

      Constant time for append and pop operations from
      both ends is achieved by storing pointers to the 
      both ends of the doubly linked list.


#### 3. Using collections.deque() as a queue
Of course, deque can be used as a simple queue. You just 
need to ignore the fact that you can add elements to the 
head and remove them from the back.

Here is an example:

      my_queue = deque()

      my_queue.appendleft('First')
      my_queue.appendleft('In')
      my_queue.appendleft('First')
      my_queue.appendleft('Out')
    
      print(my_queue)

      # Deque(['Out', 'First', 'In', 'First'])

      print(my_queue.pop())

      # First

      print(my_queue.pop())

      # In

      print(my_queue.pop())

      # First

      print(my_queue.pop())

      # Out

So, as you can see, we get the elements in the same order
as we put them in the queue. Note that if you call `pop()`
one more time you will get an exception because there
are no more elements in the queue to be popped:

    my_queue.pop()

    # IndexError: pop from an empty deque

To avoid this, you can always check if the queue is non-
empty before trying to get the next element from it. This
can be done with the help of the `len()` method:
  
    len(my_queue)

    # 0

    my_queue.append('a')
    len(my_queue)

    # 1

#### 4. Conclusions
- *Queue* is a first-in-first-out data structure.
- *Queue* is at the heart of the job scheduling in
  parallel computing.
- *Deque* stands for a double-ended queue. You can
  add and retrieve elements to/from both sides of the 
  deque.
- In Python, deque is implemented in the 
  `collections` module.
- You can use deque as a queue.
