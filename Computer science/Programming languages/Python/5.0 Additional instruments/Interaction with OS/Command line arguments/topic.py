# Theory: Command line arguments

# Using the command line is sometimes very useful in the
# programmer's work. And Python scripts can be run from
# the command line just like its regular commands, e.g.
# "cd" or "mkdir". This means we can write a module that
# can take data as input, do something with it, and return
# the result. In this topic, we'll see how we can make that
# happen.
