# Theory: Random module

# Sometimes it happens that we lack data and need to make up a
# bunch of new examples rather quickly. Of course, you can spend
# some time writing those examples yourself, but it's not so
# efficient, right? It would make more sense to shift teh
# responsibility to your computer, namely, the Python's built-in
# module random. In this module, a random search is used to
# generate elements and is performed using an algorithm whose
# starting point is a seed. Therefore, the results given aren't
# random at all and, technically, this module should have been
# called pseudo-random. Nevertheless, it may be useful for a
# large number of applications, such as modeling and simulation.

# 1. Random method: first steps
# First of all, we need to import the module:
import random

# After we've managed to do the previous task, it's possible to try
# the random.random() function that will provide us with a
# pseudo-random number from 0 to 1:
print(random.random())  # 0.5877792945154963

# We can also control the pseudo-random behavior by specifying
# the seed manually, i.e configure the new sequence of pseudo-
# random numbers using the random.seed(x) function. You can
# set your own number or omit the optional argument x and
# consequently current system time would be used by default.

random.seed(20)
print(random.random())

# Now try to set the x argument. Haven't you noticed the change
# of the result? If you choose 5, you'll get 0.6229016948897019
# as a result, if 20 - 0.9056396761745207, etc. Thus, the seed
# controls the behavior of pseudo-random in Python and can be
# used with any other function of the random module.

# 2. Random basic functions
# Moving forward, other useful functions are:

# - random.uniform(a, b) - returns a pseudo-random float
#   number in the range between a and b:
print(random.uniform(3, 100))  # 69.56665323159015

# - random.randint(a, b) - returns a pseudo-random integer
#   number in the range between a and b:
print(random.randint(35, 53))  # 52

# - random.choice(seq) - returns pseudo-random element
#   from non-empty sequences:
print(random.choice('Voldemort'))  # m

# - random.randrange(a, b, c) - returns a pseudo-random
#   number from a range between a and b with a step c. Just
#   like with the range() function, the start and step
#   arguments may be omitted with the default values 0 and 1
#   respectively. It means the function can take one, two,
#   or three parameters:

print(random.randrange(3, 100, 5))  # 18
print(random.randrange(1, 5))       # 2
print(random.randrange(100))        # 44

# - random.shuffle(seq) - shuffles a sequence. Attention: it
#   doesn't work with immutable datatypes!

tiny_list = ['a', 'apple', 'b', 'banana', 'c', 'cat']
random.shuffle(tiny_list)
print(tiny_list) # ['b', 'c', 'cat', 'banana', 'a', 'apple']

# - random.sample(population, k) - returns a pseudo-random
#   k length list from a population sequence. This function is
#   used for random sampling without replacement.

print(random.sample(range(100), 3))  # [13, 16, 40]

# Furthermore, there are plenty of other functions that are used in
# common mathematical practice, e.g.
# random.gammavariate(alpha, beta) that is used for gamma
# distribution or random.gauss(mu, sigma) that returns Gaussian
# distribution. If you need such narrow-specialized function, you
# can address the Python documentation.

#       The pseudo-random generators of the random module
#       should NOT be used for security purposes. If you are
#       intending to work with passwords, security tokens and
#       other sensitive data, check out the secrets module. It's
#       considered more reliable since it generates secure
#       random numbers.

# 3. Summary
# To sum up, in this topic, we've looked closely at random module
# from a Python standard library and its basic functionality. Now
# you can use it in your projects yourself!
