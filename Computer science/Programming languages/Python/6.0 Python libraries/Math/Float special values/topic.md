## Theory: Float special values

When thinking about numbers, we tend to imagine
something practical and specific, rather than abstract.
The first though might be to count things: how old are
we, how many animal special are there on our planet and
how many stars in the sky. It comes naturally to our
minds, that's why we put the label *natural* on those
numbers. Yet, there's more to the picture. Counting is not
the only thing we are good at. For example, we can
measure physical quantities to explore the world around
us. These real-life challenges are better described by **real
numbers**. As you know, **floats** represents real numbers in
Python, but they have more to offer. Today we will discuss
some abstract concepts and find out in what respect the 
Python floats have gone beyond the real number line.

#### 1. What is infinity?
The concept of infinity might be somewhat difficult to
perceive. Let's try to visualize it! We can take our galaxy
for starters. Is the Milky Way big enough? Until about 100
years ago, you might have thought so, but the answer is
different now (here is a [timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_knowledge_about_galaxies,_clusters_of_galaxies,_and_large-scale_structure) to consult with). So what
comes next: two galaxies, a galactic cluster, the universe,
the multiverse? Let's stop right there and highlight the
pattern of such reasoning.

When we call something infinite what we basically mean
is that it is always possible to add one more. No matter
how large is the number we come up with, the infinite
value will be greater than it. Say, we've picked a really
large number *n*, well, there will always be *n+1* and so on.

#### 2. infinity constants
In Python, infinity is a constant greater than any real
number. This special value is denoted as `inf`. Where can
you encounter it? For example, you intend to convert
`10^3000` to float:

`print(float(10 ** 3000))    # OverflowError`
`print(float("1e3000"))     # inf`

This number is too large to be represented, but you can
still convert it to float if you pass it as a floating-point
literal. The second line doesn't generate an overflow and
returns `inf` instead, which is pleasant because you can
work with it and perform further arithmetic operations.

If you want to experiment with an infinite value, there is a 
better way to obtain one. Just use floating-point literals
again: either `"infinity"` or `"inf"`. The case doesn't 
matter, what is more, your string may contain leading and
trailing whitespace characters:

`inf_var = float("INFINITY  ")   # inf`
`inf_war = float("INFINITY WAR") # ValueError: could  not convert string to float`

Infinity has a counterpart `-inf`. The negative infinity
constant is less than any real number. You can get it just
as easily:

`print(float("-inf"))   # -inf`

The constants `inf` and `-inf` support basic arithmetic
operations, as all floating-point numbers do:

`inf = float("inf")`

`# addition`
`print(inf + inf)       # inf`
`print(inf + 1)         # inf`

`# multiplication`
`print(-inf * -66)      # inf`
`print(-inf * inf)      # -inf`

`# subtraction`
`print(-inf - inf)       # -inf`
`print(inf - 9999)       # inf`

Let us dwell on a few details. First, you can't have two
infinities or double infinity. It's an ever-increasing value in
case of `inf`, and sort of the ever-decreasing one when it
comes to `-inf`. Both constants are part of the floating-
point arithmetic system, so its rules will generally apply.
In case of addition, multiplication or subtraction, you are 
likely to get infinity (the sign depends).

`# division`
`print(-inf / 100)   # -inf`
`print(inf / inf)    # nan`
`print(inf / 0.0)    # ZeroDivisionError`

`# integer division`
`print(1 // inf)     # 0.0`
`print(inf // 1)     # nan`
`print(5.0 // 0)     # ZeroDivisionError`

The division examples may also prompt some questions.
In Python, division by zero always raises
ZeroDivisionError, however, in other programming
languages, you can get away with this if at least one of
the operands is a real number.

In real-world tasks, `inf` and `-inf` can be used for
comparisons. They can be used to optimize algorithms
and find the lowest and the highest values in some list of 
values, for example, the lowest cost.

Now, we need to clarify `nan`, to which we devote the next
section.

#### 3. Meet NaN
Floating-point numbers include another special value
called `NaN`, which stands for **N**ot a **N**umber. `NaN` is not
equal to any floating-point number (including *itself* and
Â± *inf*). The idea behind `NaN` is that forbidden arithmetic
operations still need a value to return. Here is an
example:

`pos_inf = float("+inf")`
`neg_inf = float("-inf")`

`print(pos_inf + neg_inf)    # nan`

As you are well aware, multiplication by zero results in 
zero. The `NaN` value is even more contagious: most
arithmetic operations on it return `NaN`. However, a
counter-example is `NaN ** 0`, it produces *1.0*.

    The systematic use of *NaN* and *infinity constants*
    was introduced by the IEEE 754 standard in 1985.
    IEEE 754 specified how numeric values should be
    represented in computer hardware and addressed
    many issues found in diverse floating-point
    implementations.


#### 4. NaN vs None
Although, the constants `Nan` and `None` sound similar,
there is a difference between them. `None` is a singleton
object that denotes no value at all. `None` evaluates to
`False` in boolean expressions, while `Nan` doesn't. As
opposed to `None`, `Nan` is different in every given case, it
never equals to itself: you should consider `Nan != Nan`
true.

The real-world application of `Nan` is related to the lack of 
numerical data. Missing values crop up in datasets due to
numerous reasons. When the data is insufficient, `Nan` is
commonly used to substitute missing floating-point
values. Try not to mistake it for `None`.

#### 5. math.isnan()
Since the equality test `Nan == Nan` doesn't work as
intended, you might wonder how to test for `Nan` values.
There is a solution in the standard library. The function
`isnan(x)` from the **math** module determines whether x is
a floating-point "not a number" value.

`import math`

`inf = math.inf     # an alternative way`
`nan = math.nan     # to get the constants`

math.isnan(nan)     # True
math.isnan(inf)     # False
math.isnan(0.0)     # False

The function returns `True` only when its argument is
`Nan`.


#### 6. math.isinf()
The **math** module also provides a function `isinf()` to
check for an *infinity* value (either positive or negative).

`math.isinf(inf)     # True`
`math.isinf(-inf)    # True`
`math.isinf(3.14)    # False`

As seen from the example, math.isinf() works for both
`inf` and `-inf` and returns a boolean value.

#### 7. math.isfinite()
The function `math.isfinite(x)` returns `True` if *x* is 
neither an *infinity* value nor a *NaN*, and `False` otherwise.

`math.isinf(inf)     # True`
`math.isinf(-inf)    # True`
`math.isinf(3.14)    # False`

`math.isfinite()` helps find the floating-point numbers
distinct from the special values.

        Similar functions can be found at other resources.
        For example, the library for scientific computing
        [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) provides the following functions: *isinf*,
        *isposinf*, *isneginf*, *isnan*, and *isfinite*. We recommended
        that you use some of the mentioned functions, for 
        they are more likely to return the up-to-standard
        result.

#### 8. Summary
Let's go over the main points:
- Python floats include the special values `inf`, `-inf`
  and `nan`.
- The `inf` constant is greater than any real number.
  To create it, use `float("inf")` or `math.inf`. Its
  main use case is comparisons.
- The `-inf` constant is less than any floating-point
  number. You can obtain it via `float("-inf")` or 
  `-math.inf`. It has the same application as `inf`.
- The `nan` constant stands for *"not a number"* and is
  not equal to any float. You can encounter `nan` when
  dealing with data analysis. It often indicates missing
  floating-point values in teh dataframes. Use
  `float("nan")` or `math.nan` to get it.
- The **math** module has functions designed for special
  value tests: `math.isinf()`, `math.isnan()`,
  `math.isfinite().`
