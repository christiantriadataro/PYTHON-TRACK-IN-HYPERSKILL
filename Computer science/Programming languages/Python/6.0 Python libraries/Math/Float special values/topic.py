# Theory: Float special values

# When thinking about numbers, we tend to imagine
# something practical and specific, rather than abstract.
# The first thought might be to count things: how old are
# we, how many animal species are there on our planet and
# how many stars in the sky. It comes naturally to our
# minds, that's why we put the label natural on those
# numbers. Yet, there's more to the picture. Counting is not
# the only thing we are good at. For example, we can
# measure physical quantities to explore the world around
# us. These real-life challenges are better described by real
# numbers. As you know, floats represent real numbers in
# Python, but they have more to offer. Today we will discuss
# abstract concepts and find out in what respect the
# Python floats have gone beyond the real number line.

# 1. What is infinity?
# The concept of infinity might be somewhat difficult to
# perceive. Let's try to visualize it! We can take our galaxy
# for starters. Is the Milky Way big enough? Until about 100
# years ago, you might have thought so, but the answer is
# different now (here is a timeline to consult with). So what
# comes next: two galaxies, a galactic cluster, the universe,
# the multiverse? Let's stop right there and highlight the
# pattern of such reasoning.

# When we call something infinite what we basically mean
# is that it is always possible to add one more. No matter
# how large is the number we come up with, the infinite
# value will be greater than it. Say, we've picked a really
# large number n, well, there will always be n + 1 and so on.

# 2. Infinity constants
# In Python, infinity is a constant greater than any real
# number. This special value is denoted as inf. Where
# you encounter it? For example, you intend to convert
# 10^3000 to float:

# print(float(10 ** 3000))        # OverflowError
# print(float("1e3000"))          # inf

# This number is too large to be represented, but you can
# still convert it to float if you pass it as a floating-point
# literal. The second line doesn't generate an overflow and
# returns inf instead, which is pleasant because you can
# work with it and perform further arithmetic operations.

# If you want to experiment with an infinite value, there is a
# better way to obtain one. Just use floating-point literals
# again: either "infinity" or "inf". The case doesn't
# matter, what is more, your string may contain leading and
# trailing whitespace characters:

# inf_var = float("INFINITY   ")      # inf
# inf_war = float("INFINITY WAR")     # ValueError: could not convert string to float

# Infinity has a counterpart -inf. The negative infinity
# constant is less than any real number. You can get it just
# as easily:

# print(float("-inf"))      # -inf

# The constants inf and -inf support basic arithmetic
# operations, as all floating-point numbers do:

inf = float("inf")

# addition
# print(inf + inf)        # inf
# print(inf + 1)          # inf

# multiplication
# print(-inf * -66)   # inf
# print(-inf * inf)   # -inf

# subtraction
# print(-inf - inf)   # -inf
# print(inf - 9999)   # inf

# Let us dwell on a few details. First, you can't have two
# infinities or double infinity. It's an ever-increasing value in
# case of inf, and sort of the ever-decreasing one when it
# comes to -inf. Both constants are part of the floating-
# point arithmetic system, so its rules will generally apply.
# In case of addition, multiplication or subtraction, you are
# likely to get infinity (the sign depends).

# division
# print(-inf / 100)       # -inf
# print(inf / inf)        # nan
# print(inf / 0.0)        # ZeroDivisionError

# integer division
# print(1 // inf)         # 0.0
# print(inf // 1)         # nan
# print(5.0 // 0)         # ZeroDivisionError

# The division examples may also prompt some questions.
# In Python, division by zero always raises
# ZeroDivisionError, however, in other programming
# languages, you can get away with this if at least one of
# the operands is a real number.

# In real-world tasks, inf and -inf can be used for
# comparisons. They can be used to optimize algorithms
# and find the lowest and the highest values in some list of
# values, for example, the lowest cost.

# Now, we need to clarify nan, to which we devote the next
# section.

# 3. Meet NaN
# Floating-point numbers include another special value
# called NaN, which stands for Not a Number. NaN is not
# equal to any floating-point number (including itself and
# Â±inf). The idea behind NaN is that forbidden arithmetic
# operations still need a value to return. Here is an
# example:

# pos_inf = float("+inf")
# neg_inf = float("-inf")

# print(pos_inf + neg_inf)       # nan

# As you are well aware, multiplication by zero results in
# zero. The NaN value is even more contagious: most
# arithmetic operations on it return NaN. However, a
# counter-example is NaN ** 0, it produces 1.0

        # The systematic use of NaN and infinity constants
        # was introduced by the IEEE 754 standard in 1985.
        # IEEE 754 specified how numeric values should be
        # represented in computer hardware and addressed
        # many issues found in diverse floating-point
        # implementations.

# 4. NaN vs None
# Although, the constants NaN and None sound similar,
# there is a difference between them. None is a singleton
# object that denotes no value at all. None evaluates to
# False in boolean expressions, while NaN doesn't. As
# opposed to None, NaN is different in every given case, it
# never equals to itself: you should consider NaN != NaN
# true.

# The real-world application of NaN is related to the lack of
# numerical data. Missing values crop up in datasets due to
# numerous reasons. When the data is insufficient, NaN is
# commonly used to substitute missing floating-point
# values. Try not to mistake it for None.


# 5. math.isnan()
# Since the equality test Nan == Nan doesn't work as
# intended, you might wonder how to test for NaN values.
# There is a solution in the standard library. The function
# isnan(x) from the math module determines whether x is
# a floating-point "not a number" value.

import math

inf = math.inf              # an alternative way
nan = math.nan              # to get the constants

# print(math.isnan(nan))      # True
# print(math.isnan(inf))      # False
# print(math.isnan(0.0))      # False

# The function returns True only when its argument is
# NaN.

# 6. math.isinf()
# The math module also provides a function isinf() to
# check for an infinity value (either positive or negative).

# print(math.isinf(inf))      # True
# print(math.isinf(-inf))     # True
# print(math.isinf(3.14))     # False

# As seen from the example, math.isinf() works for both
# inf and -inf and returns a boolean value.

# 7. math.isfinite()
# The function math.isfinite(x) returns True if x is
# neither an infinity value nor a Nan, and False otherwise.

# print(math.isfinite(7.54))   # True
# print(math.isfinite(inf))    # False
# print(math.isfinite(nan))    # False

# math.isfinite() helps find hte floating-point numbers
# distinct from the special values.

        # Similar functions can be found at other resources.
        # For example, the library for scientific computing
        # NumPy provides the following functions: isinf,
        # isposinf, isneginf, isnan and isfinite. We recommend
        # that you use some of the mentioned functions, for
        # they are more likely to return the up-to-standard
        # result.


# 8. Summary
# Let's go over the main points:
# - Python floats include the special values inf, -inf
#   and nan.
# - The inf constant is greater than any real number.
#   To create it, use float("inf") or math.inf. Its
#   main use case is comparisons.
# - The -inf constant is less than any floating-point
#   number. You can obtain it via float("-inf") or -
#   math.inf. It has the same application as inf.
# - The nan constant stands for "not a number" and is
#   not equal to any float. You can encounter nan when
#   dealing with data analysis. It often indicates missing
#   floating-point values in the dataframes. Use
#   float("nan") or math.nan to get it.
# - The math module has functions designed for special
#   values tests: math.isinf(), math.isnan(),
#   math.isfinite().
