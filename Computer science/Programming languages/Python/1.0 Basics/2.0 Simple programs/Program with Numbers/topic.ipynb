An even more valuable skill we are about to learn is the processing of user data. With its help, you can interactive and by far more flexible applications. So let's get started!"

At the moment, we won't focus on it; but don't worry, more information about errors is available in a dedicated topic. Now, consider a more detailed and pragmatic example of handling numerical inputs."

Now we are getting to the point: you can use the operators `+=` and `-=` to increase or decrease the counter respectively.\n",
