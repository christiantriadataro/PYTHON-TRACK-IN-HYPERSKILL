    "\n",
    "Python 2.0 was released in 2000. This version has become very popular among programmers. Different 2.x subversions (2.6, 2.7) are still used in various projects and libraries. The symbol **x** in 2.x means any subversion of Python 2.\n",

    "Python 3.0 was the next major version released in 2008. It broke backward compatibility with its predecessors in order to rid the language of historic clutter and make Python more readable and consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, two similar but incompatible versions of Python are commonly used. Knowing about the compatibility of Python versions will likely help you in the future. If you know it, you can easily read through the older code and correct it, so it will run without any mistakes in newer Python versions."
