# A little about strings
# Often programmers face a problem that can be solved by
# analogy. You are already familiar with the string data type,
# Now you need to study the relevant section of the
# documentation about strings to solve this problem. In the
# documentation you will find the necessary similar examples.

# Your task is correct the code so that the output would be the
# following:
print(r"It isn`t in the section 'C:\some\name_of_file'")
