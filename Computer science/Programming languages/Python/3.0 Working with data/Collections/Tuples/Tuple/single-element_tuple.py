# Alice tried to define a singleton tuple with the first and only
# item [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]. Alas, one small detail is
# missing here. Fix the code Alice wrote.

# You are NOT supposed to create a new variable for the tuple or
# print anything.

# fix the code below
singleton = ([0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21], )
