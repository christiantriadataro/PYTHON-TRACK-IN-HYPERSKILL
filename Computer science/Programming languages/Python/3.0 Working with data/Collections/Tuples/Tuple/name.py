# From the input, you get the first and last name of a person.
# Create a tuple with the full name: the first element should be
# the first name and the second element should be the last name.
# Save the resulting tuple to the variable full_name. DO NOT
# print anything!

# The variables first_name and last_name have already been
# read from input.

# Example. Suppose first_name is "John" and last_name is
# "Doe". The resulting tuple should be ("John", "Doe")

# put your python code here
first_name = input()
last_name = input()

# create full_name here
full_name = (first_name, last_name)

print(full_name)
