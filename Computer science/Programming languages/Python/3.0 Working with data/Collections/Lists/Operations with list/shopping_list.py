# Ruth goes shopping today, so she is busy making a 
# shopping list.

# She wrote down things that would like to but at the
# grocery_store. All of these things are in the given
# shopping_list variable, it has already been created.

# When sneaking a look at the fridge, she noticed that there
# was some milk left and changed her mind about buying a
# new one. It go crossed out of the list. And, finally, she
# added a "brownie", and it became the last item Ruth had
# put on the list.

# Now you try to remove "milk" from the given variable
# shopping_list, and add "brownie" to it.

# DON"T print the results.

# remove a product and add another one; do not create a variable, it has already been created
shopping_list.remove("milk")
shopping_list.append("brownie")
