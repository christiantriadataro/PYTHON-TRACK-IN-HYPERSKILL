# Theory: Dictionary methods

# You already know how to create a dictionary and access its
# items. In this topic, you are going to learn about other features
# of dictionaries.

# 1. Alternative dictionary creation
# You know that there are two ways to create a dictionary. Using
# curly braces with a comma- separated list of key: value pairs
# or the dict constructor. We will learn about the fromkeys
# method that creates a new dictionary with specified keys and
# values. This is the syntax for this method:

# dict.fromkeys(keys, value)

# The keys parameter is a sequence of elements that will
# become the keys of a new dictionary. The value parameter is
# optional and defaults to None, but the user can specify a value
# for all keys in the dictionary. Look at the example below:

planets = {'Venus', 'Earth', 'Jupiter'}

# initializing by default with None
planets_dict = dict.fromkeys(planets)
print(planets_dict) # {'Jupiter': None, 'Venus': None, ', 'Earth': None}

# initializing with a value
value = 'planet'
planets_dict = dict.fromkeys(planets, value)
print(planets_dict)  # {'Earth': 'planet', 'Venus': 'planet', 'Jupiter': 'planet'}

# changing the value of 'Jupiter'
planets_dict['Jupiter'] = "giant" + planets_dict['Jupiter']
print(planets_dict)
# {'Earth': 'planet', 'Venus': 'planet', 'Jupiter': 'giantplanet'}

# The word was added successfully! But now we want to create a
# dictionary that would store the names of the satellites for those
# planets. Some planets have several satellites, some do not have
# them at all, so it is more convenient to use a list as a value.

# some satellites of the Solar System
satellites = ['Moon', 'Io', 'Europa']

# initializing with a empty list
planets_dict = dict.fromkeys(planets, [])
print(planets_dict)

# Let's add the items from the satellites list to the
# corresponding planets. Look, this is what happened to our
# dictionary:

planets_dict['Earth'].append(satellites[0])
planets_dict['Jupiter'].append(satellites[1])
planets_dict['Jupiter'].append(satellites[2])
print(planets_dict)
# {'Earth': ['Moon', 'Io', 'Europa'], 'Venus': ['Moon', 'Io', 'Europa'], 'Jupiter': ['Moon', 'Io', 'Europa']}

# We see that all the elements of the satellites list have been
# assigned to all planets in our dictionary. This happened because
# the fromkeys method assigns the same object to all keys.
# While referring to different keys of the planets_dict dictionary,
# we are still referring to the same list. The difference from the
# previous example is that if we use mutable objects (a list, a
# dictionary) as values, all changes will also apply to our
# dictionary. The solution is to use the dictionary comprehension:

planets_dict = {key: [] for key in planets}
print(planets_dict)
# More details on this operation will be provided in another topic
# on dictionary operations.

# 2. Adding items
# Suppose we want to add items to an existing dictionary. You
# know one way to do it - define a new key and new value:
# existing_dict['new key'] = 'new value'. But there is another
# way - use the update method. The method updates the
# dictionary with new elements from another dictionary or an
# iterable of key-value pairs.

# Let's create a dictionary and define months as keys, and the
# average temperature for this month as values. So we have the
# following testable dictionary:

testable = {'September': '16°C', 'December': '-10°C'}
another_dictionary = {'June': '21°C'}

# adding items from another dictionary
testable.update(another_dictionary)
print(testable) # {'September': '16°C', 'December': '-10°C', 'June': '21°C'}

# adding a key-value pair
testable.update(October='10°C')
print(testable)
# {'September': '16°C', 'December': '-10°C', 'June': '21°C', 'October': '10°C'}

# If the specified key already exists in the dictionary, the method
# will update the key with the new value:

testable = {'September': '16°C', 'December': '-10°C'}
testable.update(December='-20°C')

print(testable)

# 3. Getting and removing items
# We learned how to create a dictionary and add elements to it.
# But what if we need to get some value from the dictionary or
# also remove an item? The following methods will help you deal
# with different tasks depending on your needs.

# 1. Get a value from the dictionary by a key.

# As you remember, we can access the value in a dictionary by a
# key:

# testable = {}
# testable['September'] = '16°C'

print(testable['September'])  # '16°C'

# However, if you try to access a non-existent key, you will get a
# KeyError:

# print(testable['June'])  # throws a KeyError

# To avoid the KeyError, we can use the get method that
# returns None if the specified key is not in the dictionary:

# 'get' method does not throw an error
print(testable.get('September')) # 16°C
print(testable.get('June')) # None

# With the get method, we can also define the default value that
# will be returned in such a case:
print(testable.get('June', 'no temperature')) # no temperature

# 2. Remove the key from the dictionary and return the value
#    using the pop method.

# If the specified key was found in the dictionary, then the method
# will remove it and return the value:
testable = {'September': '16°C', 'December': '-10°C'}
return_value = testable.pop('December')

print(return_value)  # -10°C
print(testable) # {'September': '16°C'}

# If the key was not found, a KeyError will appear:
# testable.pop('July')  # throws a KeyError

# To get rid of it, we can provide a default argument, and it will
# return this default value:

return_value = testable.pop('July', 'no temparature')
print(return_value)

# 3. Remove and return the last item (key, value) added to the
# dictionary using the popitem method:

testable = {'September': '16°C', 'December': '-10°C'}
return_value = testable.popitem()

print(return_value)  # ('December', '-10°C')
print(testable)  # {'September': '16°C'}

# Pay attention, if the dictionary is empty, a KeyError will appear:
testable = {}
# return_value = testable.popitem()
# KeyError: 'popitem(): dictionary is empty'

# Before Python 3.7, the popitem method removes and
# returns a random item from the dictionary, not the last
# one added.

# 4. Cleaning the dictionary
# All the methods described above return a value or an item (key,
# value) upon removing, but sometimes this is not what we want.
# There are two ways that remove an item from the dictionary
# (they do not return anything) or the entire dictionary content at
# once.

# 1. Delete (remove from a dictionary) a value by its key with the
# del keyword:

testable = {'September': '16°C', 'December': '-10°C', 'July': '23°C'}

# this will remove both the key and the value from dictionary object
del testable['September']
print(testable)  # {'December': '-10°C', 'July': '23°C'}

# throws a KeyError because there's no such key in the dictionary
# del testable['May']

# throws a KeyError because we've already deleted the object
# del testable['September']

# deletes the whole dictionary
del testable

# 2. Remove all the items and return an empty dictionary using
#    the clear method:
testable = {'September': '16°C', 'December': '-10°C', 'July': '23°C'}

testable.clear()  # remove all elements
print(testable)   # {}

# 5. Differences in removal methods
# You may wonder, is there any difference between dict = {}
# and dict.clear()? Let's say we have another variable that
# refers to the same dictionary:

testable = {'December': '-10°C', 'July': '23°C'}
another_testable = testable

# Then, the dict = {} just creates a new empty dictionary and
# assigns it to our variable. Let's go back to the example above
# and assign empty dictionary to testable:

testable = {}
print(testable)  # {}
print(another_testable)  # {'December': '-10°C', 'July': '23°C'}

# another_testable still points to the original dictionary with the
# same elements, so it doesn't change.

# In constrast, the clear method will clear the dictionary as well
# as tall the objects referring to it:

testable = {'December': '-10°C', 'July': '23°C'}

testable.clear()
print(testable)  # {}
print(another_testable)  # {}

# 6. Summary
# What have we learned in this topic?
# - a new fromkeys method for alternative dictionary
#   creation; we also found out its peculiarities,
# - different methods to access elements and/or remove
#   them by key(get, pop), as well as by adding order
#   (popitem),
# - discovered how to add new items to the dictionary with
#   the update method,
# - the del keyword and how to use it,
# - got acquainted with the feature of cleaning the dictionary
#   (dict = {} and dict.clear()).
