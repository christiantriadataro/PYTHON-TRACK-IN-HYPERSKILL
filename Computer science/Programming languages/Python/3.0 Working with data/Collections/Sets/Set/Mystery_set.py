# Mystery set
# There is an unknown set of objects named mystery_set which
# has been predefined. You don't have access to this set.

# Write a program that deletes the input string (stored in the
# variable string) from the mystery_set. It is NOT
# guaranteed tha the string is an element of the
# mystery_set. Don't forget to take that into account!

# Don't print anything!
