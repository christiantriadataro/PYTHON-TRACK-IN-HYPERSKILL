    "    An important thing to remember, however, is that the string is an **immutable** data type! It means that you cannot just change the string in-place, so most string methods **returns a copy** of the string (with several exceptions). To save the changes made to the string for later use you need to create a **new variable** for the copy that you made or **assign the same name** to the copy. So, what to do with the output of the methods depends on whether you are going to use the original string or its copy later.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first group of string methods consists of the ones that \"change\" the string in a specific way, that is they return the copy with some changes made.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for calling a method is as follows: a string is given first (or the name of a variable that holds a string), then comes a period followed by the method name and parentheses in which arguments are listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a list of common string methods of that kind:\n",
    "    * `str.replace(old, new, count)` replaces all occurrences of the `old` string with the `new` one.\n",
    "     The `count` parameter is optional, and if specified, only the first `count` occurrences are replaced in the given string.\n",
    "    * `str.upper()` converts all characters of the string to upper case.\n",
    "    * `str.lower()` converts all characters of the string to lower case.\n",
    "    * `str.title()` converts the first characters of each word to upper case.\n",
    "    * `str.swapcase()` converts upper case to lower case and vice versa.\n",
    "    * `str.capitalize()` changes the first character of the string to upper case and the rest of lower case.\n",
