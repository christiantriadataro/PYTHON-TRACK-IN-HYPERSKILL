# Markdown syntax is used to format text. There are several ways
# to emphasize words using Markdown:

# Read an input and prase the text so that it  doesn't include
# special symbols mentioned in the table ("*_~`") at its
# beginning and its end.

# Pay attention to the 'code' example, ` is not the same as '!

# Do not forget to print the result.

print(input().strip('*_~`'))
print('civic'.strip('vci'))
