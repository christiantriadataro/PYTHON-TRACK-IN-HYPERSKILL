    "#### 1. Quotes\n",
    "As you know, a string literal is surrounded by a pair of **single** or **double quotes**. There is basically no difference\n",
    "between the two, but there are some common conventions concerning their use:\n",
    "* Use double quotes if your string contains single quotes, for example, `\"You're doing great!\"`.\n",
    "* Use single quotes if your string contains double quotes, for example, `'Hve you read \"Hamlet\"?'`.\n",
    "* Do not mix two styles in one literal! For example, something like `\"string!\"` is not correct.\n",
    "* Most importantly, be consistent in your use!\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a way to include any quotes in your string, regardless of the style of the outer quotes, and that is to use the **backslash symbol** (`\\`) before the quotes inside the of the string. The backslash will basically tell Python that the quote symbol that follows it is a part of the string rather than its end of beginning. It is called **escaping**, and you'll learn about it in detail in the next topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, both ways to writing string are correct and will produce the same result:"

    "#### 2. Multiline strings\n",
    "Strings can represent a long text, a single character, or even no characters, like in the case of an empty string. One thing has so far been true about all of them: all our strings were single line, no matter how long they were. However, you can also write **multi-line** strings in Python! To do that, you need to use **triple quotes** on each side of the string literal. Again, the choice of single or double quotes is up to you as both work fine in Python.\n",
