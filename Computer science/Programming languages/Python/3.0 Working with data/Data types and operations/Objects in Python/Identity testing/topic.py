# By now, you know how to work with values in Python. For
# example, you know how to perform arithmetic operations
# with numbers. But what is a value in Python? It can't be an
# abstract thing, like in math, because a computer should be
# able to work with it. In this topic, you will get some
# understanding of values in Python.

# Many copies of equal values
# Equal values in Python can exist in many copies. Consider
# the following code:
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
c = a

print(a)  # [1, 2, 3]
print(b)  # [1, 2, 3]
print(c)  # [1, 2, 3]

# It looks like all these variables are the same. But they
# aren't in some sense. To see it le'ts modify the list a.

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
c = a

a[0] = 5

print(a)  # [5, 2, 3] - changed
print(b)  # [1, 2, 3] - didn't change
print(c)  # [5, 2, 3] - also changed

# The reason is that we created two copies of [1, 2, 3].
# Variables a and c refer to the first copy, and b refers to
# the second copy. Changing one of them doesn't affect the 
# other one.

# We call these copies as object. An object is stored in
# memory and contains information about an abtract value
# it represents. So there can be several objects that
# represent the same value. You can treat such objects as
# twins. At first glance, they look identical, but actually,
# they are different people.

# Id function
# Each object in Python has an associated integer called 
# identity. You can get this integer by passing the object to
# the function id. Triple-quoted string, strings and other primitive
# types are also objects and they have an identity too.
# identity never changes during the life of the object.
# Different objects in memory have different identities.

# Using it we can distinguish two objects in Python that
# contain the same value. It is similar to distinguishing
# twins by looking at their indentity documents.

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]

print(a == b)   # True, they contain the same value

# But they have different identities
print(id(a))    # 4558721352
print(id(b))    # 4560238984

#   Python generates id on the fly, running the piece
#   of code above will give you other integer values.
#   Moreover, new objects can have smaller ids than the
#   objects created earlier.

# But if two variables refer to the same object, then the id
# function will return the same vallue.

a = [1, 2, 3]
c = a

print(a == b)  # True, they contain the same value

# And they also have the same identity
print(id(a))    # 4558721352
print(id(c))    # 4558721352

# As you can see, the variables a and c share the identity,
# which means they refer to the same object.

# Identitfy testing
# You can check if two variables refer to the same object by
# comparing the results of the id function. But there is a 
# better way to do it. Python has an identity operator is
# that checks if two objects have the same identity. The
# result is a boolean value: True or False. You should not
# confuse it with the equality operator == which tests
# whenther two objects contain the same value.

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]

identity_test = a is b  # False, because a and b refer to different objects in memory
equality_test = a == b  # Truem because a and b contains the same value

b = a

identity_test = a is b  # True, because now both variables refer to the same object

# The is not operator is the negation of the is operator.
# It returns True if its operands refer to different objects.
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5]

print(a is not b)   # True, as expected

# Use the identity operator carefully
# Using the identity operator instead of the equality
# operator might lead to lots of mistakes. The example 
# below shows the danger of the is operator.
a = int(input())   # 10
b = int(input())   # 10
print(a is b)      # True
print(id(a))       # 4462719392
print(id(b))       # 4462719392

a = int(input())  # 100000
b = int(input())  # 100000
print(a is b)     # False
print(id(a))      # 4446218032
print(id(b))      # 4466218160

# The reason for such weird behaviod is that Python
# optimizes the use of small integers between -5 and 256.
# They are commonly used, so Python doesn't create a new
# object every time, but gives a reference to a existing
# number. The same thing happens to short strings.

# Howevery, the case of large numbers depends on the 
# implementation, You mag get True for the folliwing
# expression:

a = 100000
b = 100000
print(a is b)  # True or depending depending on your system.

# When to use the identity operator
# The proper case to use the is operator is to test if something is
# None. None is a special keyword in Python that is used to define
# no value.

# It is safe to use is in this case, because None is a singleton. This
# means that None object is created only once and then used
# whenever you refer to in your code.

# It is common to use None as a default value for optional
# arguments in functions.

def say_hello(name=None):
    if name is None:
        print('Hello!!')
    else:
        print(f'Hello!, {name}!')

say_hello()         # 'Hello!!'
say_hello('Nick')   # 'Hello!, Nick!'

# True and False are also singletons, so you can use is with
# them too.

# Summary
# In this topic, we've learned a little about objects in Python and
# how to test objects for identity. In order not to make mistakes in
# your code pay attention to the following points.

#  - There can be many objects containing the same value. They
#    are equal but not identical.
#  - The identity operator does not compare values, but it checks
#    if its operands refer to the same object.
#  - Don't use the identity operator with primitive types.
#  - Use the identity operator to test if something is None.
