# There is a function called add_book(). It takes an argument
# called title (a non-empty string) and adds this title to
# recommendations.

# Share your favorite book with us: call this function in the code.
# Note that to pass the book title, you need to specify the
# keyword argument tittle in the call.

# You don't need to declare the function, just call it in your code.
