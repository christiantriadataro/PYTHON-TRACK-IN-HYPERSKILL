# Write a function equation_writing() that will print the
# equation in the following format: a x + b = c. The function
# must take three arguments: a, b, c, these values are subject
# to change. The rest of the equation remains unchanged.

# You are NOT supposed to handle input or call a function, just
# implement it.
