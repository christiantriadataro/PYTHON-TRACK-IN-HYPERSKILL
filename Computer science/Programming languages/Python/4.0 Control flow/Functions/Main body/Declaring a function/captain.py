# Define a function that will add the word "captain" before the
# name of a person.

# The function should be named captain_adder, take one
# argument name and print the string, i.e. it doesn't have to 
# return anything.

# You don't need to call your function, only implement it. Also,
# you don't need to take input, the name variable should come to 
# your function as an argument.

# declare your function here

def captain_adder(name):
    print("captain", name)
