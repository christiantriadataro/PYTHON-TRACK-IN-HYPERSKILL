# Let's take your skill of converting miles to kilometers to the next
# level! Define a function that accepts the number of miles and
# returns this distance in kilometers.

# Assume that one mile is approximately equal to 1.609
# kilometers.

# You don't have to handle input, just implement the function.

# put your python code here
def mi_to_km(number_miles):
    return number_miles * 1.609
