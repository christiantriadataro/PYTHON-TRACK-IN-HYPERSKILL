# The classical introductory exercise, slightly modified. Write a 
# program that takes a string, writes it to the variable name (this
# part of code is already written for you), and then prints "Hello!,
# world! Hello!, name". Note that there's aspace before the name.

# The variable name is already defined.

name = input()
print("Hello!, world! Hello!,", name)
