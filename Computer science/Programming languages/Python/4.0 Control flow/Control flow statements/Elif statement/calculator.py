# Let's write a simple calculator!
# it will read 3 lines:
# the first number
# the second number
# the arithmetic operation.

# Triple-quoted string are floats!

# The output is the result of the following: first_number
# operation second_number

# Operations are: +, -, /, *, mod, pow, div.
# mod - modulo operation, i.e. the remainder of the division
# first_number % second_number,
# pow - exponentiation, the first number will be the base and the
# second- the power: first_number ** second_number, 
# div - integer division first_number // second_number.

# Note that if the second number is 0 and you want to perform
# any of the operations /, mod, or div, the calculator should
# say "Division by 0!"

# put your python code here
