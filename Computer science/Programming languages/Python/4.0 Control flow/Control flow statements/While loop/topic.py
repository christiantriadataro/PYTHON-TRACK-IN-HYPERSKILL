# Sometimes one iteration (=execution) of a statement is not
# enough to get the result you need. That is why Python offers a
# special statement that will execute a block of code several
# times. Meet the loop command and one of the universal loops -
# the while loop.

# People generally don't choose Python to write fast code. The
# main advantages of Python are readability and simplicity. As the
# while loop requires the introduction of extra variables, iteration
# takes up more time. Thus, the while loop is quite slow and not
# that popular. It resembles a conditional operator: using the
# while loop, we can execute a set of statements as long as the
# condition is true.

# The condition itself (2) is written before the body of the loop
# (some call it the conditional code) and is checked before the
# body is executed. If the condition is true (3a), the iterations
# continue. If the condition is false (3b), the loop execution is
# terminated and the program control moves further to the next
# operation.
#                        3a) conditional code
#                                     ^ True
#                                     |
#                                           False
# 1. while statement --------> 2. condition --------> 3b) next block

# 1. Visualization
# If we visualize the while loop, it'll look like this:
number = 0
while number < 5:
    print(number)
    number += 1
print("Now, the number is equal to 5")

# The variable number plays here the role of a counter - a
# variable that changes its value after each iteration. In this case,
# the iterations continue until the number is equal to 5 (note that
# the program outputs the value of the number before increasing
# it). When the value of a counter reaches 5, the program control 
# moves to the next operation and prints the message. Here you
# can see the output of this code:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# Now, the number is equal to 5


# 2. The infinite loop
# If you delete a part of the conditional code where you increase
# the value of a counter, you will bump into the infinite loop. What
# does it mean? Since you don't increase your variable, a
# condition never becomes false and can work forever. Usually, it
# is a logical fallacy, and you'll have to stop the loop using special
# statements or finishing the loop manually.

# Sometimes the infinite loop can be useful, e.g. in querying a 
# client when the loop works continuosly to provide the constant
# exchange of information with a user. You can implement it by
# writing True as a condition after the while header.

while True:
    ...

# 3. Conclusion
# Now you are familiar with the while loop and its usage. Don't 
# forget about the role of a counter, otherwise, you'll have to deal
# with the infinite loop. After you've written the code, try to "run"
# it as if you were a Python program. That'll help you understand
# how the loop works.

# Programming is all about simplificaiton, so the code should be
# readable, short, and clear. Don't forget about comments and
# syntax. In the beginning, it may seem that the while loop is not
# that easy to implement, but after a couple of times, you'll see
# that it's a very useful tool.
