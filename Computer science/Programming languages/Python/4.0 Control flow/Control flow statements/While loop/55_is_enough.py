# Write a program that reads numbers until a user enters 55.
# Once 55 is entered, stop reading the input, print out how
# many numbers have been entered, their total sum, and
# average (do the rounding this way: round(number)). Do NOT
# include 55 in your calculations and print each resulting value
# on a new line in the order given above. round(sum(num) / len(num), 0

# while True:
#    n = int(input())
#    if n == 55:
#        break
#    num.append(n)
