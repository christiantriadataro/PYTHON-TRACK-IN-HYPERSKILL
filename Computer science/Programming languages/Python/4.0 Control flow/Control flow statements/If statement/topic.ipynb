    "So, in Python, a piece of code that should be executed only under some condition should be placed within the body of an **if statement**. The pattern is the same as in the English language: first comes the keyword `if`, then a condition, and then a list of expressions to execute. The condition is always a **Boolean expression**, that is, its value equals either `True` or `False`. Here is one example of how the code with a conditional expression should look like:"

In Python, *only* indentation is used to separate different blocks of code, hence, only indentation shows which lines of code are supposed to be executed when the `if` statement is satisfied, and which ones should be executed *independently* of the `if` statement.
