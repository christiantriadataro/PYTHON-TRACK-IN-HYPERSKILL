# Theory: PyCharm basics

# When you start programming, choosing the right IDE can
# be tricky. We encourage you to use PyCharm - one of the
# most powerful Python IDE developed by JetBrains. It has
# a very user-friendly interface and provides a variety of
# usefulfeatures like automatic code completion, project
# indexing, package management, etc.

# We also suggest PyCharm Community Edition (available
# on our website) - it's free and is powerful enough to
# write fairly large programs. If you want more information
# on Pycharm, you can visit the official PyCharm webpage.
# You can also find the guide to PyCharm installation.

# 1. The first project in PyCharm
# Now we are going to write your first 'Hello!, World' script
# using PyCharm Community. We assume that you have
# already installed it on your computer.

# 1. When you open PyCharm for the first time, you'll be
# offered a few setting options. Feel free to experiment,
# you can change them any time you want. Choose the UI
# them you like the most:

# 2. You will be offered a few plugins to install. You do not
# really need them for now, but you should know, that
# PyCharm can be easily be customized. You can always install
# new plugins in Settings | Plugins.

# 3. Once customization is done, you can either create a
# new project, open an existing one, or check out from any
# version control system like Git or Bitbucket. If you are just
# starting and don't have any existing projects, just press
# the 'Create New Project' button.

# 4. Choose the path for your future project, where all the
# project files will be stored. For educational purposes, the
# name of the project will be "FirstProject". It has a drop-
# down menu: Project Interpreter: New Virtualenv
# environment. It meams that your project will be created
# with new default settings. It means that it will be isolated
# from other projects. Let's get a bit deeper into it.

# Imagine you have 3 projects, each written on a different
# Python version: 2.7; 3.5; 3.7. They can also have different
# sets of libraries installed. To avoid conflicts and make the
# development process clearer, we create all projects in
# different folders with different interpreters. For now, we
# can proceed with the "Create" button, but let's have
# look at the settings of the interpreter.

# 5. The first option is the path to a new virtual
# environment. This is a virtual environment, an isolated
# "quasi-" Python distribution with itw own available
# libraries and the Python built-in package manager, which
# allows you to install external libraries. The Base
# interpreter drop-down menu indicated the path of the
# actual Python, which you download and install to your
# computer.

# Let's say you have downloaded Python 2.7 and installed it
# into C:/python2.7, and Python 3.7 - C:/python3.7.

# Now if you want to create a new project on Python 2.7,
# you will choose C:/python2.7/python.exe as the base
# interpreter for this project. In case you want to start a
# new project on Python 3.7, you will choose
# C:/python3.7/python.exe as the base interpreter for a
# project, written on Python 3.7.

# Each of these projects will have its own dependencies -
# the libraries available (or required) for a specific project.

# 6. By opening the root directory, you will see another
# folder - your new virtual environment , which contains all
# Python settings for this project. The settings include
# libraries and the Python version.

# 2. PyCharm capabilities
# We have created the framework for our project, but we
# still don't have a place where we can type our code. To
# create a new Python file in your project, you can either go
# to File | New | Python file, or right-click the FirstProject |
# New | Python file. Enter the name and hit OK.

# This will create a new .py file in your project folder:

# Now you can finally write the lines you desired:
print("Hello! world!")

# To run the program in PyCharm, you can right-click on the
# .py file and press Run or use the shortcuts. To know more
# about PyCharm shortcuts, you can check the Shortcuts
# section on the official website. You can choose your
# operating system in the top right corner:

# After running a specific file for the first time, PyCharm
# will remember it, so you can rerun the program by
# clicking the green Play button in the top left corner:

# If you don't have the Play button, go to View ->
# Appearance and check Toolbar.

# When the program is executed, the result will appear in
# the Run tool window at the botttom of the screen:

# The first line shows the path to the project interpreter
# and the path to the program which has been executed by
# this interpreter. The result of your program execution will
# follow. If you need more detailed information on
# PyCharm, you can always refer to the official tutorial.

# 3. PyCharm settings
# PyCharm is a very customizable IDE. Try going to File |
# Settings. There you will notice are a lot of sections. For
# example, you might want to change the PyCharm theme.
# We use Darcula. To find the specific settings, you can use
# the search box, as shown below:

# PyCharm is very intuitive and powerful IDE, and it also
# has a free community edition.

# 4. Some other IDEs you can work with
# PyCharm Community is not the only IDE you can work
# with if you want to complete the projects on our website.

# First, let's look at the variety of PyCharms. In addition to
# the Community version, there are two other editions:
# Eductional and Professtional.

# 1) Professional edition supports many other programming
# languages like JavaScript and HTML for web
# development, database support, and a lot of features you
# might need once you become a pro. You can get a free
# trial on the official website to try this eiditon out!

# 2) Educational edition is based on the Community Edition
# and includes all functionality but it has several significant
# differences:

#  - Edu version has a lightweight design with hidden
#    elements that ar enot needed at first steps.
#  - You don't need to install anything other than
#    PyCharm Edu. All other items will be installed
#    automatically.

# Another way to work with Python is to install the IntelliJ
# IDEA plugin that copies all PyCharm capabilities. If you
# already have the IDEA installed, it is the fastest way to
# start coding in Python. Bear in mind that IDEA was
# initially developed for Java users, so some tools may be
# inconvenient for a person who is studying Python.

# It does not really matter where you start after all. You can
# try them all and find what suits you best!

# 5. Conclusion
# In this topic, we found out:
# - how to start a new project in PyCharm Community.
# - a little bit about the virtual environment and python
#   versions.
# - how to create fiels in PyCharm projects.
# - a few shortcuts that make the developer's life much
#   easier
